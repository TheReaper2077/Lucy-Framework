# Lucy-Framework

An OpenGL based Game Framework ( It's like an engine, but not really ), similar to SDL2 or SFML with the added advantage of Batch Rendering. Wait, I think SDL2 and SFML does have batch rendering.

Why the Fuck did I make this ? Why are we Here ? Just to suffer ?

Fuck You mine will be a lot faster and flexible than both SDL2 and SFML. ( hopefully )

I'm using GLFW for making the Window and OpenGL context and for Events management.

I hate OOP so this project is written in FYES (Fuck-You-Eat-Shit) Paradigm. Which is a mix of some stupid Functional Programming Patterns combined with stupid OOP patterns.

It's 2AM now and I have Maths exam at 8, I should probably sleep...
